Initial PR: TBD <!-- Reference the PR first proposing this document. Oooh, self-reference! -->


<!--
This template is intended to be used by those who would like to pitch a new project for one of the Web3 Dev project teams to take on. It should contain sufficient detail that others can understand how this project contributes to our teamâ€™s mission of  product-market fit for our unified stack of protocols, what is included in scope of the project, where to get started if a project team were to take this on, and any other information relevant for prioritizing this project against others.
Good project scope aims for ~3-5 engineers for 1-3 months (though feel free to suggest larger-scoped projects anyway). Projects do not include regular day-to-day maintenance and improvement work, e.g. on testing, tooling, validation, code clarity, refactors for future capability, etc.

### Purpose &amp; impact 
##### Background &amp; intent
_Describe the desired state of the world after this project? Why does that matter?_
<!--
Outline the status quo, including any relevant context on the problem youâ€™re seeing that this project should solve. Wherever possible, include pains or problems that youâ€™ve seen users experience to help motivate why solving this problem works towards top-line objectives. 
-->

Today Protocol Labs operates gateway and set of boostrap nodes to help the network grow. But that introduces centralization point & people building on top of IPFS often need to setup their own custom infrastructure. This fragments the ecosystem and introduces complexity of having to configure client nodes appropriately, additionally it makes it difficult to share expertice.

Teams building products on IPFS are burdened with configure nodes to use their own infrastructure, which causes network fragmentation.

It would help an ecosystem if there was a coop tasked with maintaining and growing infrastructure. That would enable teams building on IPFS to get involved and invest into scaling and maintanance of the infrastrcuture for all of the ecosystem as opposed to building one for themself only.

### Required resources

##### Effort estimate
<!--T-shirt size rating of the size of the project. If the project might require external collaborators/teams, please note in the roles/skills section below). 
For a team of 3-5 people with the appropriate skills:
- Small, 1-2 weeks
- Medium, 3-5 weeks
- Large, 6-10 weeks
- XLarge, >10 weeks
Describe any choices and uncertainty in this scope estimate. (E.g. Uncertainty in the scope until design work is complete, low uncertainty in execution thereafter.)
-->

##### Roles / skills needed
<!--Describe the knowledge/skill-sets and team that are needed for this project (e.g. PM, docs, protocol or library expertise, design expertise, etc.). If this project could be externalized to the community or a team outside PL's direct employment, please note that here.-->
