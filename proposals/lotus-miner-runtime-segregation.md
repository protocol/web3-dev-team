<!--
This template is for a proposal/brief/pitch for a significant project to be undertaken by a Web3 Dev project team.
The goal of project proposals is to help us decide which work to take on, which things are more valuable than other things.
-->
<!--
A proposal should contain enough detail for others to understand how this project contributes to our team’s mission of product-market fit
for our unified stack of protocols, what is included in scope of the project, where to get started if a project team were to take this on,
and any other information relevant for prioritizing this project against others.
It does not need to describe the work in much detail. Most technical design and planning would take place after a proposal is adopted.
Good project scope aims for ~3-5 engineers for 1-3 months (though feel free to suggest larger-scoped projects anyway). 
Projects do not include regular day-to-day maintenance and improvement work, e.g. on testing, tooling, validation, code clarity, refactors for future capability, etc.

## Required resources

#### Effort estimate
<!--T-shirt size rating of the size of the project. If the project might require external collaborators/teams, please note in the roles/skills section below). 
For a team of 3-5 people with the appropriate skills:
- Small, 1-2 weeks
- Medium, 3-5 weeks
- Large, 6-10 weeks
- XLarge, >10 weeks
Describe any choices and uncertainty in this scope estimate. (E.g. Uncertainty in the scope until design work is complete, low uncertainty in execution thereafter.)
-->
