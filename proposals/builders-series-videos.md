## Purpose &amp; impact 
#### Background &amp; intent
_Describe the desired state of the world after this project? Why does that matter?_

Prospective w3dt developers — particularly those discovering the stack as part of our "hackathon life" focus — are inspired, informed and empowered by a series of short testimonial/value-demo videos showcasing w3dt builders, their successful projects, and how the stack has enabled their success. They understand how a builder's project is unique, disruptive, or otherwise valuable; how the w3dt stack is critical to the project's success; and where they can go next to learn more and get started themselves.

The first of these videos (featuring Pinata) will be prominently showcased on ipfs.io, on our social channels, and at hackathons for maximum discoverability and impact.

#### Assumptions &amp; hypotheses
_What must be true for this project to matter?_

✓ Prospective developers want to know about existing success in areas similar to theirs

✓ Showcasing known wins is essential to inspiring others to adopt the w3dt stack

✓ We have enough known-win builders to be able to make a positive impact by showing them off

#### User workflow example
_How would a developer or user use this new capability?_

1. Prospective developer or other decisionmaker is curious about decentralization/dweb/web3 in general, and/or the w3dt stack or IPFS in particular
2. They watch one or more Builders Series videos, discovered via ipfs.io, PL-managed social channels, or hackathon welcome materials
3. They quickly understand the following, relative to their own need at hand:
     - Other interesting orgs are already building and succeeding with IPFS, Filecoin, and other parts of the w3dt stack
     - These orgs are unique, disruptive, successful and valuable; they're making the world a better place
     - The w3dt stack is critical to their projects' success
     - These orgs are enthusiastic IPFS/Filecoin/w3dt supporters, and encourage others to try them out
     - Where to go for next steps
4. They try the stack themselves and progress to the next circle in the Magic State Machine

#### Impact
_How would this directly contribute to web3 dev stack product-market fit?_

These videos are an explicit demonstrator of w3dt product-market fit: They literally lay out how w3dt stack ingredients fit into the functional success of high-value builders.

#### Leverage
_How much would nailing this project improve our knowledge and ability to execute future projects?_

Getting this messaging right enables us to effectively reach a wide range of prospective devs at the very front of the funnel, an area we have historically underserved. With our increased focus on hackathon participants and bettering the "first experience" of our websites and social media, this project is a highly versatile, largely evergreen, widely reusable touchpoint for kicking off the developer acquisition process.

#### Confidence
_How sure are we that this impact would be realized? Label from [this scale](https://medium.com/@nimay/inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-impact-confidence-ease-and-gist-5180434e5b15)_.

- **Impact = 9** (currently no high-level short videos available showcasing _possibilities_ of the tech; currently no videos on top of ipfs.io, nor specific illustrations of IPFS in action)
- **Confidence = 8** (user testing specifically revealed need for more high-level video content; also specifically flagged as hackathon need)
- **Ease = 6** (COVID presents some challenges, but work itself isn't difficult and is somewhat repeatable)


## Project definition
#### Brief plan of attack
1. Determine shortlist of orgs to profile, including first video subject - note this will need to factor in ability to do effective work and still be COVID-safe
2. Draft, discuss and align on repeatable story outline for series: what needs to be conveyed, in what order, for all videos?
3. Determine what's available to us visually within our budget, and align on a repeatable plan for shooting/editing reliably within budget
4. Create story guide and interview questions, determine overall visual aesthetic, etc
5. Shoot and edit PoC video (Pinata)
6. Post on ipfs.io, all appropriate social channels, and include in upcoming hackathons; measure and gauge reaction/enthusiasm
7. Tweak and repeat for remaining videos (including determining how many videos in entire series)

#### What does done look like?
- Initial video is finished and published to ipfs.io, YouTube, and our social media channels
- Video is ready for presenting as appropriate to future hackathons
- Timelines for work on future videos has been determined and agreed upon (or a decision deferral date set)

####  What does success look like?
- Positive reception (likes, comments, reposts) on social media
- Positive reception in hackathons
- Click-through rate for "additional resources" offered in video end card
- Other collabs enthusiastically willing to be video subjects

#### Counterpoints &amp; pre-mortem
_Why might this project be lower impact than expected? How could this project fail to complete, or fail to be successful?_

- Not showcasing the highest-impact builders, builders that offer empathy/identification for potential builders, etc.
- Not creating enough videos for them to offer useful contrast and counterpoint as a set
- Not promoting adequately enough via social, hackathons, etc

#### Alternatives
_How might this project’s intent be realized in other ways (other than this project proposal)? What other potential solutions can address the same need?_

- Adding more case studies scratches a similar itch, but ignores those for whom video is a preferred learning method

#### Dependencies/prerequisites
None. _Note, however, that we won't get as thorough of watch metrics if we embed on existing ipfs.io site than we would on a replatformed, Countly-enabled ipfs.io as described in https://github.com/orgs/ipfs/projects/11._

#### Future opportunities
- An expanded series of videos - either just _more_ videos, or _more focused_ videos for audiences like "building NFTs", "building on Ethereum", etc
- Followup materials for each video — case studies, opportunities for hackathon tie-in talks from the builders, etc

## Required resources

#### Effort estimate
Shirt size: Medium/large (per video)

_Note that this proposal is for the first video in the series only; the intent is to re-propose for future videos once we have a little time to gauge initial video's performance._

#### Roles / skills needed
- Project lead/PM (Jessica Schilling): Coordinate tasks, manage schedule/dependencies, ensure adherence to spec, etc
- Video team (Zak Robinson, Nick Cucci): Cooordinate video shoot and production, edit, manage approval workflow
- Video graphics (TBD - may be outsourced): Create any static or motion graphics used in videos
- Site implementation (Zé Bateira): Add video(s) to ipfs.io, including any additional metrics events if site is replatformed by then
- Social media implementation (PL marketing team): Disperse via all appropriate social channels
