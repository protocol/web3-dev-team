# [Measure task completion on stack websites] 

Authors: @atopal

Initial PR: https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/pull/38


## Purpose &amp; impact 
#### Background &amp; intent
_Describe the desired state of the world after this project? Why does that matter?_

We don't know why people come to our websites and how succesful they are with the things we care about. In order to prioritize our efforts and track progress, we need to survey our users regularly and make that available to the teams that can take action. Our product websites/docs  are a also a good place to gage general satisfaction with PL and our pproducts.


#### Assumptions &amp; hypotheses
_What must be true for this project to matter?_
- The experience of people who come to our websites is relevant to the success of PL
- We don't already have this information
- We'll be able to identify the workflows we care about and will be able to isolate them in the survey
- The results will be reliable enough to base prioritization on
- We'll be able to take action based on the data collected

#### User workflow example
_How would a developer or user use this new capability?_
* user visits website and gets a message to answer 4 simple questions
* survey opens up in separate tab, user is asked to come back when they are done
* user does what they came to the website to do
* user takes the survey
* 4 questions (examples, need to be refined)
    * How satisfied are you with the experience you had today on ipfs.io/filecoin.io?
    * What task did you want to accomplish on ipfs.io/filecoin.io today? 
    * Were you able to accomplish the task that brought you to ipfs.io/filecoin.io today?
        * if not: Can you tell us more about your challenges on ipfs.io/filecoin.io  from today's visit?
    * How dissapointed would you be, if IPFS/Protocol Labs disappeared?
* data is collected
* data is available for all PL teams to slice and dice
* data is presented regularly as measure of success

Note: we'd probably need a screener question to make sure only actual users answer the "How dissapointed would you be" question.

#### Impact
_How would this directly contribute to web3 dev stack product-market fit?_

We'd have a reliable way to identify user frustrations early in the process and address them.

#### Leverage
_How much would nailing this project improve our knowledge and ability to execute future projects?_

This tool can be used as a lagging indicator for completed projects, but also to identify projects that are worth pursuing. 

#### Confidence
_How sure are we that this impact would be realized? Label from [this scale](https://medium.com/@nimay/inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-impact-confidence-ease-and-gist-5180434e5b15)_.

It's a low effort way to stay on top of changing user sentiment, but initial successs depends on whether it will identify anything that we don't already know about.

## Project definition
#### Brief plan of attack

- Identify survey provider
- construct survey
- design messaging flow on websites
- implement messaging on websites

#### What does done look like?
_What specific deliverables should completed to consider this project done?_

- Users take surveys on PL websites every day
- Results are presented initially
- Results are presented regularly

####  What does success look like?
_Success means impact. How will we know we did the right thing?_

- We identify something new that needs to be addressed
- We increase confidence in an opportunity/problem that needs to be addressed

#### Counterpoints &amp; pre-mortem
_Why might this project be lower impact than expected? How could this project fail to complete, or fail to be successful?_

- If the assumptions are not met
- Difficulty in finding a survey provider with acceptable privacy policy and cost structure
- Not enough people taking the surveys on a regular basis

#### Alternatives
_How might this projectâ€™s intent be realized in other ways (other than this project proposal)? What other potential solutions can address the same need?_

- We can interview people on a regular basis to identify their goals and how successful they have been in the past
- We can do a one time survey that we advertise heavily on all our channels
