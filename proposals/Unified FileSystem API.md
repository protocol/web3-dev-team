# Unified FileSystem API

Initial PR: TBD <!-- Reference the PR first proposing this document. Oooh, self-reference! -->

<!--
This template is intended to be used by those who would like to pitch a new project for one of the Web3 Dev project teams to take on. It should contain sufficient detail that others can understand how this project contributes to our teamâ€™s mission of  product-market fit for our unified stack of protocols, what is included in scope of the project, where to get started if a project team were to take this on, and any other information relevant for prioritizing this project against others.
Good project scope aims for ~3-5 engineers for 1-3 months (though feel free to suggest larger-scoped projects anyway). Projects do not include regular day-to-day maintenance and improvement work, e.g. on testing, tooling, validation, code clarity, refactors for future capability, etc.

Today IPFS comes with two sets of FileSystem APIs, one offering global network level view (and is less file systemy) and second local node level (mutable) view. Not only thas is confusing and suboptimal, but neither provide an adequate solution for various use cases:

###### File Tree in DAGs

Sometimes you want to stick tree of files into a DAG. This is reasonable straight forward with `ipfs.add` API if tree structure can be represented as stream of file paths and contents. 

However there are cases where representing a file tree as a steam is impractical (e.g. it happens in response to on various events). Such cases are much better serverd with `ipfs.files` API, however it is also not ideal because tree built ends up in the node local FS path and concurrent tasks could introduce race condititions.

###### Multitenant Nodes

When multiple apllications share an IPFS node they end up with shared local filesystem view, which is impractical because they can introduce race condition and access each others secret files.


###### Content Froking

Neither of the existing file system APIs are adequate for forking file tree and performing edits on it. Global filesystem API does not really has write API, and with local filesystem API file tree needs to be assigns a path, which not only requires adding file tree and removing afterwards but is also prone to race conditions.

---

What we need instead is an API similar to `ipfs.files` that can be instantiated with an arbitrary `CID`. This would address all the above use cases.

**TODO**: Talk to collabs to figure out if we could further abstract this so that it's just as easy to plug encryption.
