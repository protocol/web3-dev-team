<!--
This minimal project pitch (MPP) template is for a proposal/brief/pitch for a significant project to be undertaken by a Web3 Dev project team.
The goal of project proposals is to help us decide which work to take on, which things are more valuable than other things.
-->
<!--
A minimal project pitch (MPP) should contain enough detail for others to understand what problem this project solves and why this is important for our
team's goal of achieving product-market fit, a high-level description of what the idea/proposed solution is, and space to add more detailed technical 
design and planning information as we develop this information.

The MPP itself does not need to describe the work, technical design, scope, and project plan in much detail.

Projects can include work for major programs (such as Bedrock and Nitro), but they can focus on other areas, e.g. refactors for future capability, 
improving our testing infrastructure, testing and validation, and other engineering-oriented projects.

## What is the problem this project solves?
_Describe the status quo, including any relevant context on the problem you're seeing that this project should solve. Who is the user you're solving for, and why do they care about this problem? Wherever possible, include pain points or problems that you've seen users experience to help motivate why solving this problem works towards top-line objectives._ 

[filecoin.storage](http://filecoin.storage) is a "getting started" interface for dapp developers that want to use IPFS+Filecoin to address and persist their data. It aims to be the easiest way to use the golden path through IPFS+Filecoin.

[filecoin.storage](http://filecoin.storage) plays the role of being an aggregator that works with the rest of the IPFS+Filecoin golden path. Our intention is for developers to be able to use this aggregator to start learning about how to interact with IPFS+Filecoin for storage/retrieval, and thereafter we will direct developers to other solutions like Textile Hub or other "production-level" aggregators for the developers' production needs.

The purpose of this MPP is to describe the work required to land the homepage + content plan for the bigger Filecoin.storage product. 

## Impact
_What goals/OKRs are being addressed (for w3dt, a specific program, etc.)? Why is this project important? What do we get with this project that we can't get without it?_

This is a subcomponent of the work that w3dt is working on via Nitro for filecoin.storage. This workstream is required for the overall goals for filecoin.storage and creating user-friendly experiences. 

## The idea
_Describe the proposed project solution, at a very high level. Stay at the level of the high-level requirements. Diagrams and interface descriptions can be useful, if you have any that help clarify and explain the idea._

A content plan, along with rough mocks and visual style would be the first set of deliverables. 
Working with the design team to get HighFi mocks would be the second, along with a separate stream for building the work. 

## Success/acceptance criteria (optional)
_How do we know we're done with this project? How do we know we're successful? This field is OPTIONAL for the first draft of an MPP. Sometimes this field needs to be filled out once we have more detail on the shape of the actual solution._

Delivery of the items described above. 

## Detailed plans (optional)
_Link to more detailed project plans, e.g. product requirements documents (PRDs) and technical design docs, once they have been created for this project._
Timeline for items is being tracked along side the other nitro work streams (we've broken out the first turn of content plan + design + rough mocks from the design from the design team, and the implementation work).
