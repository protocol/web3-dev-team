# filecoin.storage tutorials & docs 

Authors: @atopal

## What is the problem this project solves?
Documentation, sample code and tutorials for dApp developers who want to build on top of filecoin.storage. A simple to use client library for Filecoin is crucial for those who want to adopt Filecoin for dApp storage. Since even many dApp developers are not well versed in decentralized storage, developers need great docs that contextualize the API reference, explain concepts and give examples for how to solve specific problems in code.

## Impact
This project aims to impact the goals of:
* Time from zero to simple dapp on the w3stack
* Increasing the number of off-chain dapps using Filecoin for storage/retrieval

## The idea
* API docs
* Sample code
* Tutorials (step-by-step walkthroughs)
* Conceptual docs
* Project examples

## Success/acceptance criteria (optional)
* APIs fully documented
* First round of sample code and tutorials are published
* Docs are user tested for the tutorials
* Continuous feedback for docs is available
